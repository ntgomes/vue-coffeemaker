    <p>Coffee Maker is an onboarding project in CSC 326: Software Engineering.
      Originally made using Angular, Java Spring/Hibernate, and Apache Tomcat,
      CoffeeMaker serves as a somewhat simple example of a basic CRUD application.
      It is remade using Vue to understand CRUD and SPA application development. </p>
