# vue-coffeemaker
Vue-CoffeeMaker is a simple single-page CRUD application that manages coffee recipes and inventory counts to a MySQL database. Once authenticated, users can update the inventory, add recipes, delete recipes, edit recipes, and make coffee orders using existing recipes and inventory counts.

This project is based on NCSU CSC326 staff's CoffeeMaker implementation from Spring 2020. Their original CoffeeMaker project was made using the following set of technologies:
  * AngularJS
  * Thymeleaf
  * Spring MVC
  * Hibernate ORM
  * MySQL
  * Apache Tomcat

While almost entirely different in code structure, Vue-CoffeeMaker intends to follow the functionality as the original CoffeeMaker implementation while using a different set of technologies for frontend and backend:
  * VueJS
  * BootstrapVue
  * Node.js
  * Sequelize.js
  * Finale.js
  * MySQL
  * Okta JWT Authentication
